# Instruction

Create a program that finds the list of prime factor of given number.

It should take an integer as an input and return a list of integers.

# Rules
### Prime factors
Any positive number can be decomposed in a product of prime numbers : the prime factors.

A number is a prime number if and only if it is divisible by itself and 1.

1 is not a prime number.

### Requirements
- input range : the range of number given as an input of the program should be 1..n
- output : a list of integer

order in the list doesn't matter.

### Example

1 -> list() ( emplty list , 1 has no prime factor because it is not divisible by any prime number )  
2 -> list(2)  
36 -> list(3,3,2,2)

# Implementation

The master branch of this repository contains a skeleton of the class to be implemented as well as a first failing test.
Feel free to clone it to get started.

Another branch is available with a possible solution of this exercise.


#### Enjoy !
